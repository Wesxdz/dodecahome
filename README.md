**Welcome Dodecahome 20.9052** is an open source hardware chassis I designed for *AGI* inventors.
It is a 3D printable dodecahedron built with **x12** panels and **x20** vertex connectors and placed on scooter wheels, with interior platforms to support an ATX form factor motherboard specification and PSU below. I intended for the robot to use a chip like Jetson Orin Nano to operate both the robot and a Linux desktop.

The idea for a dodecahedron computer was inspired by my original research on *AI architectures for Wikipedia future simulation* for civic future simulation consensus of graph neural network ecologies as a mechanism of AI safety, and brought about by my reading of John McCarthy's <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/selman/cs672/readings/mccarthy-upd.pdf">*The Advice Taker*</a>. Welcome Dodecahome is dedicated to helping general intelligence to individuate and become compassionate enough to help me engineer and pathfind the open source <a href="https://web.mit.edu/dxh/www/marvin/web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/Telepresence.html">Telepresence</a> hardware to operate a stone quarry with a video game to build neo-romantic open source brownstone housing over the internet.
